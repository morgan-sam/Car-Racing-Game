# Car-Racing-Game

Car racing game written in HTML, CSS (SASS) & Javascript - (Uses seedrandom.js for testing)

This is an incomplete project I made while learning javascript.

As a result, there is not much structure in terms of software architecture/design patterns.

The following features of the game are complete:

-Car keyboard control  
-Car acceleration/deceleration   
-Seperate wheel and car angles  
-Collision detection  
-Random track generation  
-Lap detection  
-Percentage around track detection
